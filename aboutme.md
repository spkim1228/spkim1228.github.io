subtitle: All the facts you never wanted to know.

My name is Paul Kim and I'll be one of your TA's for CSCI 103 this semester! Some facts about me are that:

- I am a computer science and psychology major!
- I am currently a junior at Williams!
- I have lost a toenail before from overly tight shoes while running!

### my history

It all started in the late part of '01. I don't even remember how I was born or what happened to me the first several years after '01. All I have are stories from some older folks about what I was like. Was it me if it's something I can't even remember. How do I compartmentalize different aspects of myself. Is myself my identity or what other people have pushed onto me.
